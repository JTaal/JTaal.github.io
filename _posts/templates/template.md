The visualization you see is an attempt to represent a PLACEHOLDER_CONCEPT in a 3D space.  
# Replace PLACEHOLDER_CONCEPT with the actual concept (e.g., "four-dimensional chirp signal").

The signal is expressed as:

$$ s(t) = e^{j\theta(t)} = \cos(\theta(t)) + j\sin(\theta(t)) $$

Here, the phase `θ(t)` is PLACEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION.  
# Replace PLACEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION with what makes θ(t) special (e.g., "nonlinear in time").  

Its derivative, the instantaneous frequency, PLACEHOLDER_BEHAVIOR.  
# Replace with how the frequency behaves (e.g., "increases over time, characteristic of a chirp").

### The Axes

- **Real Axis (X):** Represents PLACEHOLDER_REAL.  
  # Replace with actual meaning (e.g., "the real part, cos(θ(t))").  

- **Imaginary Axis (Y):** Represents PLACEHOLDER_IMAG.  
  # Replace with actual meaning (e.g., "the imaginary part, sin(θ(t))").  

- **Frequency Axis (Z):** Represents PLACEHOLDER_AXIS.  
  # Replace with description (e.g., "time progression, where frequency increases and the spiral tightens").  

---

This creates the distinctive PLACEHOLDER_VISUAL_DESCRIPTION you see.  
# Replace with the actual visual outcome (e.g., "chirping spiral" or "tightening helix").
